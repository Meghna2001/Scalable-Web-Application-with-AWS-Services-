# Scalable-Web-Application-with-AWS-Services-

The project demonstrates how to build a robust, scalable, and highly available web application by leveraging various AWS offerings such as EC2 (Windows), RDS, S3, Elastic Load Balancer, Auto Scaling, CloudFront, and Route 53.

# Objective

To design and implement a scalable web application using AWS services, ensuring that the application can handle varying levels of traffic efficiently while minimizing costs. The goal is to create a robust, secure, and highly available web application that can scale seamlessly as demand grows.

# Services Used

1. Amazon EC2: For scalable compute resources.
2. Amazon S3: For static asset storage (images, videos, files, etc.).
3. Amazon RDS: For relational database services to manage data.
4. Amazon CloudFront: To distribute content globally with low latency.
5. Amazon Route 53: For domain name system (DNS) management.
6. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): To distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
7. Amazon Auto Scaling: To automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
8. AWS IAM: For secure access management.
9. AWS Lambda: For serverless computing, handling backend processes without managing servers.
10. Amazon VPC: For networking and security purposes.

# Conclusion

The project successfully leveraged various AWS services to create a scalable, secure, and cost-efficient web application. By using services like EC2, S3, RDS, and CloudFront, the application can handle traffic spikes effectively while ensuring optimal performance and availability. The use of Auto Scaling and Load Balancing ensures that the application scales automatically, providing a seamless user experience regardless of demand.
